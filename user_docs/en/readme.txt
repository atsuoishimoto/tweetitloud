NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free and open source screen reader for the Microsoft Windows operating system. This software can enable blind or vision impaired people to access computers running Windows for no more cost than a sighted person. NVDA allows the user to find out what is happening on the screen by querying the Operating system and using a speech synthesizer to output the information.

For more information, please see the included user guide. Additional information and resources can be found on the NVDA web site.
